Hi Annie,

We wanted to welcome you to the data analysis team here at MetaAppleNetflixGoogleAmazon (MANGA)!
We hope you are as excited as us to have you join the team. There is ample opportunity here for you
to learn and grow your skills as a software engineer and data analysis.

Your first week here we should have Diana helping you out with getting your workstation all set up. 
This means access to our lab report data and the internal database upload web tool; basically just got to get 
google chrome downloaded on your device so you'll be able to log in.  
This should be enough responsiblilty and of course we will be restricting your access to the server containing this tool.

Your employee ID is 15124. You will need this to log into the upload tool.
Make sure you change your password! Some employees have been caught using very easily crackable passwords.

We will meet sometime this week once you are all set up so we can go over expectations and tasks for you to get started with.

Best,
Bob Bitcoin
