The web tool is hosted on the company's network and can be accessed through the MIDORI web browser. 
We don't use chrome or firefox because they take up too much space...

You must login with your employee ID and password.

The web tool takes in csv files where the first line is the table's title.
The second line is the column headers. The third line is the data types of the columns. 
The subsequent lines are the data of the table.
